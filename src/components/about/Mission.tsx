                  <span>Transparency Over Profit:</span> We’re not here to sell
                  you on a pick. We’re here to provide you with the facts—plain
                  and simple. You deserve to know that the data you’re using is
                  trustworthy and that the platform you’re relying on isn’t just
                  another money-making scheme.

                <li>
                  <span>Empowerment Through Information:</span> We believe that
                  the best bettor is an informed bettor. That’s why we focus on
                  delivering data that is not only accurate but also actionable.
                  With PickBetta, you have the power to make your own decisions,
                  based on the most relevant information available.

                <li>
                  <span>A Commitment to Excellence:</span>After decades in the
                  betting world, I know what works and what doesn’t. PickBetta
                  is designed to offer the best of what I’ve learned—the kind of
                  resource I wish I had when I started. It’s a platform built by
                  a bettor, for bettors, with a singular focus on helping you
                  bet better.
